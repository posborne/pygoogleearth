        This method allows an external application to query the geolocation and terrain altitude 
        of a point in the 3D viewpoint identified by its normalized screen coordinates 
        (screen_x, screen_y), ranging from (-1, -1) to (+1, +1) inclusive.
        
        Here are some examples:
            * (-1, -1) - bottom left hand corner of the screen.
            * (0,0) - center of the screen.
            * (1, 1) - top right hand corner of the screen.
        
        To convert from pixel coordinates to these normalized screen coordinates, it may be helpful 
        to use GetRenderHwnd and retrieve the render window's position and dimensions for these computations.
        
        The coordinates of the point on terrain are returned in as a IPointOnTerrainGE.
        If the input screen coordinates do not intersect with the globe, then this function returns 
        the projected point on the globe's horizon and with the 
        IPointOnTerrainGE::ProjectedOntoGlobe set to true.
        
        The IPointOnTerrainGE::Altitude is set in the following way:
            * if ElevationExaggeration is non-zero, then IPointOnTerrainGE::Altitude is set to be the terrain's 
              true altitude and IPointOnTerrainGE::ZeroElevationExaggeration is set to false, or
            * if ElevationExaggeration is zero, then IPointOnTerrainGE::Altitude is set to zero and 
              IPointOnTerrainGE::ZeroElevationExaggeration is set to true.
        
        Parameters:
        screen_x   Normalized screen position along the x axis. Valid range is from -1 
                   (left hand side of the screen) to +1 (right hand side of the screen). 
                   Values outside the valid range are clamped.
        screen_y   Normalized screen position along the y axis. Valid range is from -1
                   (bottom of the screen) to +1 (top of the screen). Values outside the
                   valid range are clamped.
